# Deprecated: claude-code

This skill name is kept for **backward compatibility**.

## Use instead

- **claude-code-orchestrator** (recommended)

## What changed

The old name `claude-code` is too generic and easy to conflict with other ecosystems.

This legacy skill does not include a full workflow by itself. It exists to route humans/agents to the new canonical skill.

## Canonical skill location

The canonical implementation lives in:

- `skills/claude-code-orchestrator/`

If you installed this repository via a skill installer, install/use `claude-code-orchestrator` and follow its instructions.
